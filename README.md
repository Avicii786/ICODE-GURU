# [Icode Guru Courses](https://icodeguru.weebly.com/)

iCode Guru is a mission to promote the programming at scale.
Let us Share our professional skills, Learn from others, and Grow together.

Icode Guru provides different kind of Ict courses aiming to train students for future. Their main style of teaching is through daily online classes on facebook. You can find all the live sessions videos on their [facebook page](https://web.facebook.com/iCodeguru). To scroll and search for videos on facebook is kind of hectic so I came up with an idea to why not compile list of all the courses and put it on a single place.

You can find link to the videos of the following courses that conducted by Icode Guru.

- [Sql for Data Analysis (Stated on 13th September)](#sql)
- [Data Structures and Algorithms](#ds)
- Folio Bootcamp (Python)
- Leetcode Problems with Python
- 9PM React Js Practical Guide Session
