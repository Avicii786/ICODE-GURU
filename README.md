# [Icode Guru Courses](https://icodeguru.weebly.com/)

iCode Guru is a mission to promote the programming at scale.
Let us Share our professional skills, Learn from others, and Grow together.

Icode Guru provides different kind of Ict courses aiming to train students for future. Their main style of teaching is through daily online classes on facebook. You can find all the live sessions videos on their [facebook page](https://web.facebook.com/iCodeguru). To scroll and search for videos on facebook is kind of hectic so I came up with an idea to why not compile list of all the courses and put it on a single place.

The course are:

## Table of Contents:

- [Sql for Data Analysis (Stated on 13th September)](#sql)
- [Folio Bootcamp](#ds)
- Leetcode Problems with Python

## <a id ='ds'>FOLIO BOOTCAMP</a>
Folio bootcamp by Icode guru consist of three parts. First part has already commenced and second part is in progress. Third part will be conducted once second part is finished.

### Part - 1
Part one of this bootcamp is mainly dedicated to core python. I am not going to insert videos link of that part as you can find plenty of resources on core python on Youtube.

### Part - 2
In phase two of folio bootcamp main agenda will be to study different data structure and algorithms. And then apply that knowledge to solve leedcode problems during class.
